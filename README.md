# PDF-Downloader-Reader
This project is the demo project for downloading, storing, reading complete flow for PDF files

Hi there, this is Sheldon again and welcome back to iOS eTutorials. Today I will continue working on making a PDF file Downloader and Reader from scratch.

The whole project will cover the following knowledge:
1. Using Cocoapods to create workspace
2. Using Alamofire SDK for downloading
3. Using MBProgressHUD for showing downloading indicator/ progress
4. Using protocol and delegation to manage actions within a cell.
5. Using NSFilemanager to operate locally stored files
6. Using WKWebview to finally show our downloaded PDF file
7. Using UINavigation controller to navigate in-between different view controllers
